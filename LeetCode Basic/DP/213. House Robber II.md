# Question
You are a professional robber planning to rob houses along a street. Each house has a certain amount of money stashed. All houses at this place are arranged in a circle. That means the first house is the neighbor of the last one. Meanwhile, adjacent houses have security system connected and it will automatically contact the police if two adjacent houses were broken into on the same night.

Given a list of non-negative integers representing the amount of money of each house, determine the maximum amount of money you can rob tonight without alerting the police.

Example 1:

    Input: [2,3,2]
    Output: 3
    Explanation: You cannot rob house 1 (money = 2) and then rob house 3 (money = 2),
     because they are adjacent houses.
Example 2:

    Input: [1,2,3,1]
    Output: 4
    Explanation: Rob house 1 (money = 1) and then rob house 3 (money = 3).
     Total amount you can rob = 1 + 3 = 4.
# Solution
要分成两个dp数组讨论，一个有选中第一间房子，一个无，然后和无环状态一样的解法：
```java
class Solution {
    public int rob(int[] nums) {
        if(nums.length == 0) return 0;
        if (nums.length <= 2) return Math.max(nums[0], nums[nums.length - 1]);
        int[] dp1 = new int[nums.length + 1];
        dp1[0] = 0;
        dp1[1] = nums[0];
        int[] dp2 = new int[nums.length + 1];
        dp2[0] = 0;
        dp2[1] = 0;
        for(int i = 2;i <= nums.length;i++){
            dp1[i] = Math.max(dp1[i - 1],nums[i - 1] + dp1[i - 2]);
            dp2[i] = Math.max(dp2[i - 1],nums[i - 1] + dp2[i - 2]);
        }
        return Math.max(dp1[nums.length - 1],dp2[nums.length]);
    }
}
```
