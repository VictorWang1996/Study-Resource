# 题目
There are a number of spherical balloons spread in two-dimensional space. For each balloon, provided input is the start and end coordinates of the horizontal diameter. Since it's horizontal, y-coordinates don't matter and hence the x-coordinates of start and end of the diameter suffice. Start is always smaller than end. There will be at most 10^4 balloons.

An arrow can be shot up exactly vertically from different points along the x-axis. A balloon with xstart and xend bursts by an arrow shot at x if xstart ≤ x ≤ xend. There is no limit to the number of arrows that can be shot. An arrow once shot keeps travelling up infinitely. The problem is to find the minimum number of arrows that must be shot to burst all balloons.

> Example:
> 
> Input:
> [[10,16], [2,8], [1,6], [7,12]]
> 
> Output:
> 2
> 
> Explanation:
> One way is to shoot one arrow for example at x = 6 (bursting the balloons [2,8] and [1,6]) and another arrow at x = 11 (bursting the other two balloons).

# 解法
这次做法和之前的略有不同，这次需要找到多少个两两区间之间拥有重叠区域，因此要将区间的尾部排序，确保末区间顺序为升序（换而言之，要寻找最窄的合并区间），然后按照正常方法去进行比较和统计。
```java
class Solution {
        private class mycomparator implements Comparator<int[]>{
        @Override
        public int compare(int[] a,int[] b){
            if(a[1] < b[1]){
                return -1;
            }
            else if(a[1] == b[1]){
                return 0：
            }
            else{
                return 1;
            }
        }
    }
    public int findMinArrowShots(int[][] points) {
        if(points.length == 0){
            return 0;
        }
        Collections.sort(Arrays.asList(points),new mycomparator());
        int count = 1;
        int[] temp = points[0];
        for(int i = 1;i < points.length;i++){
            if(points[i][0] > temp[1]){
                count++;
                temp = points[i];
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
```
