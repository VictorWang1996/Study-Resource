# Question
Given a binary tree, find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the tree.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

Given the following binary tree:  root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4]

> Example 1:
> 
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 1  
> Output: 3  
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 1 is 3.

> Example 2:  
> 
> Input: root = [3,5,1,6,2,0,8,null,null,7,4], p = 5, q = 4  
> Output: 5   
> Explanation: The LCA of nodes 5 and 4 is 5, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.  

# Solution
用数字去表达子树里是否存在要寻找的点，要比用标志位要好，具体实现代码如下：
```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) { val = x; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    private TreeNode result;
    public TreeNode lowestCommonAncestor(TreeNode root, TreeNode p, TreeNode q) {
        recurseTree(root, p, q);
        return result;
    }
    public boolean recurseTree(TreeNode node,TreeNode p, TreeNode q){
        if(node == null) return false;
        int left = recurseTree(node.left,p,q) ? 1 : 0;
        int right = recurseTree(node.right,p,q) ? 1 : 0;
        int mid = (node == p || node == q) ? 1 : 0;
        if (left + right + mid >= 2){
            result = node;
        }
        return (mid + left + right > 0);
    }
}
```

此外此题可以用栈的方法来做，详细见link的solution。
